step-by-step guide to solving the problem: 

Finding the length of the longest peak 
in an array.

Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the longest peak in an 
array. A peak is defined as a 
subarray that strictly increases, 
reaches a maximum point (the tip), 
and then strictly decreases. 
The peak must be at least 3 elements 
long.

Step 2: Plan the Approach
- We will iterate through the array, 
looking for peaks.
- For each potential peak, we'll 
check how far the increasing and 
decreasing sequences extend and 
calculate the peak's length.
- Weâ€™ll keep track of the
 maximum peak length found during 
this process.

Step 3: Implement the Two-Pointer 
Technique
- Start from the second 
element (index 1) and move to 
the second-to-last element (index n-2) 
because a peak requires at least one
 element before and after the tip.
- For each element, check if it's a 
peak by comparing it with its neighbors. 
If `array[i] > array[i-1]` and `array[i] > array[i+1]`, 
then `array[i]` is the tip of a peak.

- If a peak is found, extend the pointers to the 
left and right to find the full length of the peak.

Step 4: Expand from the Tip to Measure the Peak
- Move left from the tip as long as the sequence is strictly increasing.
- Move right from the tip as long as the sequence is strictly decreasing.
- Calculate the length of this peak and update the maximum peak length if this one is longer.

Step 5: Consider Edge Cases
- Arrays with fewer than 3 elements can't have a peak.
- Arrays without any peaks should return 0.

Step 6: Implement the Code 
The Python implementation is in the .py file:

Step 7: Test the Solution
- included in the .py file

array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3, 2, 3]
print(longest_peak(array))  # Output should be 6


Step 8: Analyze the Solution
- Time Complexity: The solution is O(n) because we traverse 
each element of the array a limited number of times.
- Space Complexity: The solution is O(1) because we
 only use a fixed amount of additional space, 
regardless of the input size.
