To solve the Monotonic Array 
problem, several concepts are 
both explicitly and implicitly 
required:

### Explicit Concepts:
1. **Monotonicity:** 
   - An array is monotonic if 
     it is either entirely 
     non-increasing 
     or 
    non-decreasing.
   - Non-increasing means that 
     no element is greater than 
     the preceding one.
   - Non-decreasing means that 
     no element is smaller than 
     the preceding one.

2. **Array Traversal:** 
   - You need to traverse 
     the array from the first 
     to the last element to check 
     whether the array is 
     monotonic.

3. **Boolean Output:** 
   - The function should return 
     a boolean value 
    (`true` or `false`) based on
    whether the array is monotonic
    or not.

### Implicit Concepts:
1. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider edge cases like an 
    empty array or an array with 
   a single element, both of which
    are trivially monotonic.
   
2. **Comparisons:**
   - The solution requires 
     comparing each element with 
    the previous one to determine
    if the array is non-increasing
    or non-decreasing.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The most efficient solution 
     should ideally traverse the 
     array only once (O(n) time 
     complexity), rather than 
    sorting or making multiple 
    passes.

4. **Conditional Logic:**
   - You'll need to handle cases 
     where the array may neither 
     be entirely non-increasing 
     nor non-decreasing.

### Approach:
1. **Initialization:** 
   - Start by assuming the 
     array is both 
     non-increasing
     and 
     non-decreasing.
   
2. **Iterate Through the Array:** 
   - Traverse the array 
     and compare each element 
    with the next one. 
    Update your assumptions 
    about the monotonicity 
as you go.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After traversal, check if 
    the array is either 
   non-increasing or 
   non-decreasing based on your 
   earlier assumptions. 
  If one of them holds true, 
  return `true`; otherwise, 
  return `false`.

### Sample Implementation (Python):
```python

def isMonotonic(array):

    if len(array) <= 1:
        return True

    is_increasing = True
    is_decreasing = True

    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        if array[i] > array[i - 1]:
            is_decreasing = False
        if array[i] < array[i - 1]:
            is_increasing = False
    
    return is_increasing or is_decreasing
```
